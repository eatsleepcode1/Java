/*Driving is expensive. Write a method costForMilesGas() that takes miles driven and returns the cents, 
assuming 30 miles per gallon and a per gallon price of $4. Write a similar method costForMilesMaintenance() that assumes tires last 20,000 miles 
and cost $500, and that assumes $300 of service every 10,000 miles. Finally, write a method costForMiles() that takes miles driven, and calls those
two methods, returning total cents. Use final variables in the methods as appropriate, like MILES_PER_GAL, not hardcoded values in the method's statements.
Use only integer arithmetic throughout. If the input is 50, the output should be: 941 cents
Hints:
    Because you are only using integer arithmetic, do any divisions as late as possible, to reduce the impact of integer division ignoring fractions
    For gas, use an equation like this: centsGas = (milesDriven * CENTS_PER_GAL) / MILES_PER_GAL;
    For service, use an equation that starts like this: 
    centsMaintenance = ((milesDriven * TIRES_CENTS) / TIRES_MILES) + â€¦ (Finish by adding a similar expression for service.*/

/* NOTES

* Integer division usually benefits from doing divisions as late as possible

* An alternative approach would be to use floating-point division, and then casting to integers. However, some programmers
  believe that money should never use floating-point. We aren't as convinced, but avoided using floating-point here anyways.
  
* Integer arithmetic with multiplications and late division *could* yield numbers that are too large for an int. 
  In that case, a long might be used, or double. 
  
* Breaking a problem down into parts, and writing a function for each part, is a common pattern. Best to test each function
  separately, before putting them all together into the final program.
