/*The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.2f", yourValue);

Ex: If the input is:

49 155 148 60 
the output is:

Calories: 736.21 calories **/

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LabProgram {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
   
   double Age;
   double Weight;
   double heartRate;
   double Time;
   double calories;
   
   Age = scnr.nextDouble();
   Weight = scnr.nextDouble();
   heartRate = scnr.nextDouble();
   Time = scnr.nextDouble();
   
   calories = ((Age * 0.2757) + (Weight * 0.03295) + (heartRate * 1.0781) - 75.4991 ) * Time / 8.368;
   
   System.out.printf("Calories: %.2f calories\n", calories);
      
   }
}
